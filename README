This is the source distribution of the mucke model checker.  Be sure to
read the copyright information in the file COPYRIGHT.  To compile type:

	./configure
	make
      
For a binary distribution repeat this process on each machine
(currently only Solaris and Linux are supported).  Then run the
`./bin/mkdist' script.  You might also use the configure option

	./configure --longbdd=<dir>

each time if you have the sources of the BDD library of D. E. Long
available in directory <dir>.  The default is that dynamic libraries
are used.  For debugging purposes a static version might be preferrable.
In this case use the configuration option `--static'.
