Transition relation library

To install:

Install the storage management and BDD libraries first.

cd builddir

tar xf dist.tar

The Makefile uses an include file feature.  If your version of make
can't handle include files, you need to insert the file "dependencies"
at the end of the Makefile (and nuke the include line).

Edit the DEST* variables at the top of the file to say where things
should be installed.

make

There is a man page tr.3 describing the library interface.

This code is fairly new, and hasn't been really beat on extensively.
