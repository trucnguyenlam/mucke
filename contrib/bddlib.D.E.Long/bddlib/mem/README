Storage management library

To install:

cd builddir

tar xf dist.tar

The Makefile has changed from earlier versions of the library; it no
longer requires GNU make, but it does use an include file feature.  If
your version of make can't handle include files, you need to insert
the file "dependencies" at the end of the Makefile (and nuke the
include line).

Edit the DEST* variables at the top of the file to say where things
should be installed.

There is a man page mem.3 describing the library interface.
